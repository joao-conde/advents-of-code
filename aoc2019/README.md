## Why C++

Felt like practicing my first programming language. 

Widely used for systems programming, C++ is one of those languages that forces you to think on many low level aspects and define perfectly well your data structures.

Next year may take the time to learn Go or Rust as these are gradually overtaking C++ in systems programming.


## Run solutions

Compiled using g++ version:
```
g++ (GCC) 9.2.0
```

Using:
```
g++ day<DAY_NUMBER>.cpp -o exe
```

And running with
```
./exe
```
