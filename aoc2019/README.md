# [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019)

## Running solutions

The following assumes you are at the project root level (same as this `README.md`).

To run the solution for a given day:

```bash
$ g++ src/day[01-25].cpp -o day && ./day
```

To run all the solutions:

```bash
$ g++ src/all.cpp -o all && ./all
```

Solutions developed with:

```bash
$ g++ --version
g++.exe (MinGW.org GCC Build-20200227-1) 9.2.0
```

## Why C++

Felt like practicing one of the first programming languages I learned. Besides that, it is a systems programming language thus allowing users to write performant software. I also use it in competitive programming exercises and contests.
