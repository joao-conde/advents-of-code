## Why C++

Felt like practicing the first programming language I learned.
Next year I may take the time to learn Go or Rust as these are gradually overtaking C++ in systems programming.

## Run solutions

Compiled using g++ version:
```
g++ (GCC) 9.2.0
```

Using:
```
g++ day<DAY_NUMBER>.cpp -o exe
```

And running with
```
./exe
```
