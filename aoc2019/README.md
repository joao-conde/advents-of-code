## Running solutions

The following assumes you are at the project root level (same as this `README.md`).

To run the solution for a given day:

```bash
$ g++ ...
```

To run all the solutions:

```bash
$ g++ ...
```

Solutions developed with:

```bash
$ g++ --version
...
```

## Why C++

Felt like practicing one of the first programming languages I learned. Besides that, it is a systems programming language thus allowing users to write performant software. I also use it in competitive programming exercises and contests.
