# Advents of Code

Repository to host solutions for the [yearly advent of code challenges](https://adventofcode.com/events).

From the [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/about) page on December 2017:

> *"Advent of Code is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code. Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts that build on a theme."*

## About

My goals are simply to learn or practice a new programming language (ideally even a new paradigm) and to have fun solving puzzle-like challenges.

Some years I don't finish during the advent due to time constraints.
