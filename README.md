# Advents of code

From the [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/about) page:


*"Advent of Code is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code. Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts that build on a theme."*


## About

I will often use programming languages that I have never used and want to learn (as was the case with my first commits done in Python here) as well as some programming languages I want to practice more. Or just feel like it. This is code I do for fun outside of work so I will do as I please.
