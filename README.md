# Advents of code

From the https://adventofcode.com/2017/about page:

*"Advent of Code is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code. Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts that build on a theme."*


## Solutions

The solutions found and implemented are my own and they are often a product of quick thinking and coding. I do not intend to make super 'quality' code I only intend to come up with a program to solve the problem as quickly as possible (and to have fun of course). For this reason some of the code might be what is commonly referred to as "spaghetti code". Still I try to keep it as clean as possible thus founding a middle term between solving the problem speed and code organization.

## Why python?

It's my first time using python and I'll mainly be using Python3 due to it's simplicity allowing me to focus on the algorithm that solves the problem and decreasing the overhead required to setup a solution by other languages aswell as providing me some pratice in the python programming language.
