# Advents of code

From the [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/about) page on December 2017:


*"Advent of Code is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code. Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts that build on a theme."*


## My goals

1. learn or practice a programming language
2. have fun solving puzzle-like challenges
