# [Advent of Code 2018](https://adventofcode.com/2018)

## Running solutions

The following assumes you are at the project root level (same as this `README.md`).

To run the solution for a given day:

```bash
$ node src/day[01-25].js
```

To run all the solutions:

```bash
$ node src/all.js
```

Solutions developed with:

```bash
$ node --version
v14.15.1
```

## Why JavaScript

Widely used across the industry. In order to improve my skills I decided to do AoC2018 in JavaScript with no frameworks. Pure vanilla js.

As [Jeff Atwood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Atwood) said:

> “Any application that can be written in JavaScript, will eventually be written in JavaScript.”

It also challenges me to keep the code clean and organized.
