## Why Javascript

Despite hating it, it is widely used across the industry.
In order to improve my skills I decided to do aoc2018 in javascript with no frameworks or extra modules. Pure vanilla js.

As [Jeff Atwood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Atwood) said:

> “Any application that can be written in JavaScript, will eventually be written in JavaScript.”


It also challenges me to keep the code clean and organized.


## Run solutions

Using [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) (version 8.10.0) run:

> node day.js
