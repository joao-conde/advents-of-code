## Running solutions

The following assumes you are at the project root level (same as this `README.md`).

First install TypeScript dependencies and transpile to JavaScript with:

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm run build
```

Then, to run the solution for a given day:

```bash
$ node dist/day[01-25].js
```

Solutions developed with:

```bash
$ node --version
v16.13.0
```

```bash
$ tsc --version
Version 4.5.2
```
